1.0.0 – First release<br />

=25/08/2012= 

1.1.0 – First upgrade<br /><br />
1. A small bug that did not allow selection of featured images from library files has now been fixed. You can select from the images available in your library for portfolio items.<br />
2. Another bug that stopped sorting of portfolio category names that contained special charcters has been resolved. Now category names with special characters can be sorted. This is useful if you want to create a price-range sort feature using $ or £ etc in your category names.<br />

=31/08/2012=

1.2.0 – Second upgrade<br /><br />
1. A small bug that was hiding the item types.<br />

1.2.1 – Third (minor) upgrade<br /><br />
